        JavaScript ("JS" for short) is a full-fledged dynamic
        programming language that, when applied to an HTML
        document, can provide dynamic interactivity on websites.
        It was invented by Brendan Eich, co-founder of the
        Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla

            JavaScript is incredibly versatile. You can start small,
            with carousels, image galleries, fluctuating layouts, and
            responses to button clicks. With more experience, you'll
            be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics,
            comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!
